However, former law minister and senior advocate Shanti Bhushan said it was a very tough question. "Under Article 368, Parliament does have power to amend the Constitution. But in view of the Supreme Court's ruling in the Kesvanand Bharti case, Parliament can't amend the basic structure of the Constitution". "Unless the question is referred to the Supreme Court and the court gives its opinion, it is very difficult to give a definite answer," Bhushan said. He added it would depend on whether Article 370 is part of basic structure or not. Both Justice Khan and Dhavan said Jammu and Kashmir acceded to India under certain conditions. External affairs, communication and defence were to be handled by India but all other issues were left to the state. But over the years, many central laws have been extended to the state by Presidential orders either by the consent of the state government, or by concurrence of the state government or in some cases by approval of the state legislature.</p></div>
